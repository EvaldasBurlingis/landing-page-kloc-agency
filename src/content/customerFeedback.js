      "KLOC inherited our digital product at the beginning of 2017. This meant that not only did KLOC have to quickly get underneath the functionality and mechanics, they had to quickly learn our business model and where our platform fitted into our overall service/product proposition. It is reassuring that our platform is in good hands as the team are extremely knowledgeable, but more importantly we have a trusted partner in KLOC.",
